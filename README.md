# Mushroom-Classification-Adaboost
 Aimed at differentiating between poisonous and edible mushrooms.   Achieved  accuracy of 100% using the AdaBoost algorithm. Developed a web application using Flask to deploy the mushroom classification model, allowing users to determine the edibility of mushrooms.

#Problem Statement:
The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms contains descriptions
of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the 
Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom (1981). Each species is labelled as either 
definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or maybe edible but not recommended. This last 
category was merged with the toxic category. The Guide asserts unequivocally that 
there is no simple rule for judging a mushroom's edibility, such as "leaflets three, leave it 
be" for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.
The main goal is to predict which mushroom is poisonous & which is edible.
